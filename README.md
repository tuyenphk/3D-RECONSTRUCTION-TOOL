## 3D-RECONSTRUCTION-TOOL

# Project Overview
3D-Reconstruction Tool is a fun, enjoyable, and informative web application designed for experimentation, research, and casual learning. 
The application's cloud-hosted neural network offers symmetry detection services for 2-dimensional astronomy images, and reproduces them in a 3-dimensional format.
Cloud-based machine learning has rapidly evolved into a vital and sophisticated aspect of modern software development. The goal of the 3D Reconstruction Tool aims to explore and transform these components into an entertaining, informative platform.
